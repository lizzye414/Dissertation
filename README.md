My BSc dissertation project

## Background

The problem
Currently the students on the animal centre at Brinsbury college record information about the animals (daily husbandry tasks, health checks etc.) using a paper based system. Each accommodation has its own paper file, these get damaged regularly (due to working in wet, muddy conditions) and are difficult to keep up to date as information needs to be reprinted whenever anything changes. The animal centre houses birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. Each type of animal has a different daily requirement. There are computers on the animal centre, currently these are only used for taking registers. The animal centre would benefit from transferring to a computer based system as the records would be much easier to search, update and maintain. At present you have to review pages and pages of paper to find when tasks were carried out with animals, previous information is easily lost and a lot of information is replicated, e.g. drug information is also stored on a separate spreadsheet. Searching the information is required for many reasons, e.g. to find when the accommodations were previously totally cleaned out, as this only happens periodically; to find information about health issues and when they started; and to look at trends in amounts that the animals have eaten and whether their weight fluctuates. 

The solution
The fully developed system would centralise all information and make it more easily searchable. A prototype system was developed during this project which demonstrates some of the requirements of the full system. The solution required a way to store the information and a system for entering, retrieving and displaying information. The animal centre staff were keen for this system to be developed so agreed to help with the design, despite only a prototype being offered.
The system required large amounts of information to be stored about the animals and their husbandry, therefore a database was used for storage. I chose to use NetBeans as the IDE and a MySQL database.   
As the data needs to be accessed throughout the animal centre, a web app was considered to be most suitable as this could be used across a range of devices, e.g. the computers that are already present or hand held devices for animals outside. 

## Files included

I have included the source, testing and web files to demonstrate how the project was developed and structured. Also included are the sql files that were used to initialise the database and a document showing screenshots of the application being used.
